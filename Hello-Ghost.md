It's about time that we can put all that github markdown (.md) to good use : )

Getting used to creating nice looking pages in github, many of us githubbers will make a smooth transition into blogging on this platform.

Since it is free -- and also because my students tend to really like github -- I imagine that many of my students will really like blogging on this platform.

In closing: **Awesomeness**
